    "text": "I am Forestry Engineer, and currently I am working as researcher at the University of Córdoba in the LIFE FAGESOS Project, and more specifically, I am developing biophysical models for Phytophthora cinnamomi in the Mediterranean Basin. Furthermore, I am finishing my Master’s Degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing and Spatial Models applied to Forest Management at the same University.\nFor over two years, I have been using the programming language R in a daily basis. I try to inspire others to use it, since I believe its potential is unknown by most. I mostly work doing data and spatial data analysis, statistics, modelling, remote sensing, and development of web applications. All of this applied to my field of knowledge which is forestry. Over the time, I honed my skills with R, web development languages (HTML & CSS), deployment tools (Shiny, EC2, Git, Docker), and I try to learn something new every day."

    "text": "Introducing myself\n\nMy name is Adrián Cidre González, and I hold a degree in Forestry Engineering from the University of Santiago de Compostela. Currently, I am pursuing my master’s degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing, and Spatial Models applied to Forest Management at the University of Córdoba (Spain).\nNot only am I a dedicated student, but I am also actively involved in practical research. I am currently working as a research assistant in the LIFE-FAGESOS project at the University of Córdoba. This project allows me to contribute to cutting-edge work related to forest management, protection and sustainability.\nWithin the scope of my research, I specialize in data analysis, specifically as a data analyst. One of my primary responsibilities involves creating models of pests in Europe for the LIFE-PROJECT that I am currently engaged in. Using my skills in the R environment, I perform spatial data analysis and modeling, as well as remote sensing analysis.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits and research, I am excited to use this blog as a platform to share my work, courses, and other fascinating topics that will engage and inform the public. By providing valuable insights into my field and showcasing the projects I am involved in, I aim to spark interest and foster a greater understanding of the importance of forestry, geomatics, and data analysis in sustainable forest management."
