    "text": "History\nThe rpostgis package was born around 2016, and since then, more than 20 versions have been released to CRAN (the official R repository). However, the geospatial ecosystem in R has gone through important changes during the last years (check this issue), including the retirement of the packages rgeos, rgdal, and maptools. These packages as well and sp and raster are being replaced by the packages sf (for vectorial operation), terra (for both raster and vectorial data), and stars (datacubes).\nThese changes in the geospatial ecosystem affected many other packages depending on the retired packages, including rpostgis. The authors of the package noted that they lacked time to continue the maintenance of the package, and that’s where I offered myself to maintain the package. During the last weeks I have been working on the migration of the package to the new geospatial ecosystem, and on October \\(15^{th}\\) the package was published in CRAN."

This is because we am working in the migration of the package to my GitHub repository, and then I will publish the website again probably through GitHub pages or my website. However, the main new features are:\n\nFunctions pg* migrated to packages sf/terra. Therefore, the inputs/outputs of these functions will be sf objects, SpatVector and SpatRaster objects by default. However, to maintain compatibility with recent versions, a new argument returnclass have been added to the pg* family of functions.\npgGetRast and pgWriteRast include now a progress bar to inform the user about the estimated remaining time. These progress bars can be disabled through the new function argument progress = FALSE.\nThe extension postgis_raster can be installed using the function pgPostGIS() using the new argument raster = TRUE.\nThe function pgInsert has been deprecated in favour of the function pgWriteGeom to keep naming consistency with other functions of the package."

    "text": "Write/Read vectorial data\nThe package is used as an interface between R and PostgreSQL with a PostGIS extension. Actually, the PostGIS extension can be installed using the function rpostgis::pgPostGIS(). First of all, we need to connect to our PostgreSQL server using the RPostgres or the RPostgreSQL drivers. A basic connection with a local database could be achieved as follows:\n\nconn &lt;- RPostgres::dbConnect(\n  drv      = RPostgres::Postgres(),\n  host     = \"localhost\",\n  dbname   = \"my_database\",\n  port     = 5432,\n  user     = \"adrian_cidre\",\n  password = \"awesomepassword\"\n)\n\nWe can then check if the connection was successful, and install the necessary extensions (remember also to load the package). If we just set the into the function, it will install PostGIS automatically but not other extensions:\n\nlibrary(rpostgis)\npgPostGIS(conn)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nFirst, let’s create fictional data:\n\n# Load necessary packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Create fictional tibble\npts_tbl &lt;- tibble(\n  x = seq(-8.3, -7.3, length.out = 50),\n  y = seq(42.4, 43, length.out = 50),\n  z = rnorm(50)\n)\n\n# Convert to sf\npts_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(pts_tbl, coords = c(\"x\", \"y\"), crs = 4326)\n\nSo basically, I created a sf object with POINT geometry. Now let’s imagine this is awesome data we want to save in our PostGIS database. We can use the function pgWriteGeom(conn, name, data.obj). These are the three arguments that you always must specify:\n\npgWriteGeom(\n  conn     = conn,\n  name     = c(\"public\", \"awesome_points\"),\n  data.obj = pts_sf\n)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nWe are exporting to our connection the data object pts_sf, to the public schema, and setting its name to awesome_points. The function returns TRUE when the transfer was successful. If we don’t trust it, we can use the next function to list all the vectorial data in our database:\n\npgListGeom(conn)\n\n  schema_name     table_name geom_column geometry_type     type\n1      public awesome_points        geom         POINT GEOMETRY\n\n\nExcellent! Now let’s imagine that after some time we want to get back to this file. How can we get it back into R? So, that’s pretty easy! We can use the pgGetGeom(conn, name) as easy as this:\n\n# Get the points\nawesome_pts_sf &lt;- pgGetGeom(\n  conn = conn,\n  name = \"awesome_points\"\n)\n\n# Check it\nhead(awesome_pts_sf)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -8.3 ymin: 42.4 xmax: -8.197959 ymax: 42.46122\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \n           z                       geom\n1  0.1817181          POINT (-8.3 42.4)\n2  0.1760245 POINT (-8.279592 42.41224)\n3 -0.4406823 POINT (-8.259184 42.42449)\n4 -1.8539099 POINT (-8.238776 42.43673)\n5  1.8827414 POINT (-8.218367 42.44898)\n6  0.1964005 POINT (-8.197959 42.46122)\n\n\nWe have our object back into R! You may have noticed that I used name = \"awesome_points\" instead of name = c(\"public\", \"awesome_points\"). This is because when we do not specify the schema, by default, the function will use the public schema both for reading and writing."

I am currently working as a research assistant in the LIFE-FAGESOS project at the University of Córdoba. This project allows me to contribute to cutting-edge work related to forest management, protection and sustainability.\nWithin the scope of my research, I specialize in data analysis, specifically as a data analyst. One of my primary responsibilities involves creating models of pests in Europe for the LIFE-PROJECT that I am currently engaged in. Using my skills in the R environment, I perform spatial data analysis and modeling, as well as remote sensing analysis.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits and research, I am excited to use this blog as a platform to share my work, courses, and other fascinating topics that will engage and inform the public. By providing valuable insights into my field and showcasing the projects I am involved in, I aim to spark interest and foster a greater understanding of the importance of forestry, geomatics, and data analysis in sustainable forest management."

Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n 0.3415  1.0003  1.0690     Inf  1.2067     Inf \n\n\nWe can see in the summary before that the values between the minimum and the \\(3^{rd}\\) quantile exhibit normal values, but the maximum value is infinite. This is because in some municipality there are men, but not woman (i.e. division by zero). We can see also the boxplot:\n\nboxplot(spain_pop_ready_sf$ratio_mw)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Men/Women ratio by municipallity\n\n\n\nThis tells us that a visualization of the continuous distribution will barely differentiate between area with higher women proportion (&lt;1), and areas with higher men proportion (&gt;1). Therefore, I apply the same approach creating bins:\n\n# Define the breaks (bin edges) based on percentiles\nbreaks &lt;- quantile(\n  spain_pop_ready_sf$ratio_mw, \n  probs = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)\n)\n\n# Round to hundred, and keep unique values\nbreaks &lt;- round(breaks, 2) %&gt;% unique()\n\n# Create bins\nspain_pop_ready_sf &lt;- spain_pop_ready_sf %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    ratio_bin = cut(ratio_mw, breaks = breaks)\n  )\n\n## Print bins\nprint(levels(spain_pop_ready_sf$ratio_bin))\n\n [1] \"(0.34,0.96]\" \"(0.96,0.99]\" \"(0.99,1.01]\" \"(1.01,1.04]\" \"(1.04,1.07]\"\n [6] \"(1.07,1.11]\" \"(1.11,1.17]\" \"(1.17,1.26]\" \"(1.26,1.44]\" \"(1.44,Inf]\" \n\n\nWith this code, a total of 10 bins are generated with the ranges showed above. So let’s proceed to the visualization:\n\n# Plot the population\nggplot(spain_pop_ready_sf) + \n  ## Geometries\n  geom_sf(data = world_sf, fill = \"grey90\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = ratio_bin), color = NA) +\n  ## Scales\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"RdBu\", na.translate = FALSE, direction = -1) +\n  ## Labels\n  labs(\n    title   = \"Men/Women ratio\",\n    fill    = \"Ratio\",\n    caption = \"Author: Adrián Cidre González\"\n  ) +\n  ## Coordinates\n  coord_sf(xlim = st_bbox(spain_pop_ready_sf)[c(1,3)],\n           ylim = st_bbox(spain_pop_ready_sf)[c(2,4)]) +\n  ## Theme\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.background = element_rect(color = \"black\")\n  ) +\n  ## Ggspatial\n  annotation_scale(location = \"br\") +\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"tr\", which_north = \"true\")\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Sex ratio in Spain by Municipality in 2019 (ratio men/women)\n\n\n\nCuriously, we can see that the less populated areas are also populated mostly by men, whereas coastal areas and islands tend to be more balanced, or more populated by women."
