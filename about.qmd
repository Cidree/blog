I am Forestry Engineer, and currently I am working as researcher at the University of Córdoba in the LIFE FAGESOS Project, and more specifically, I am developing biophysical models for *Phytophthora cinnamomi* in the Mediterranean Basin. Furthermore, I am finishing my Master's Degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing and Spatial Models applied to Forest Management at the same University.

For over two years, I have been using the programming language R in a daily basis. I try to inspire others to use it, since I believe its potential is unknown by most. I mostly work doing data and spatial data analysis, statistics, modelling, remote sensing, and development of web applications. All of this applied to my field of knowledge which is forestry. Over the time, I honed my skills with R, web development languages (HTML & CSS), deployment tools (Shiny, EC2, Git, Docker), and I try to learn something new every day.
