I am Forestry Engineer, and currently I am working as researcher at the University of Córdoba in the LIFE FAGESOS Project, and more specifically, I am developing biophysical models for *Phytophthora cinnamomi* in the Mediterranean Basin. Furthermore, I am studying a Master's Degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing and Spatial Models applied to Forest Management at the same University. Lastly, as a personal challenge, I am studying at the National University of Distance Education (UNED) an advanced course in Applied Statistics, since the field of applied statistics, geostatistics and machine learning inspire me.
