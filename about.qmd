I am a passionate forestry engineer with a Master's degree in geomatics, remote sensing, and spatial models applied to forest management. Currently, I am contributing my expertise as a member of the Department of Forest Engineering at the University of Córdoba. My goal is to create R-based solutions for forestry challenges. I specialize in applying Data Science and Geospatial technologies to enhance forestry management.

During my career, I worked as a firefighter for six seasons before transitioning to a GIS specialist role at the University of Córdoba while completing my Master's degree. There, I honed my skills in R, continually improving my proficiency. I strive to create efficient, reproducible, and clear code that automates common tasks in forestry.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to the possibility of learning together.
