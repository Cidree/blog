## Introduction

Today we will learn how to use the `mapsf` R package to create choropleth maps showing the number of wildfires and the burned area combined in the province of Ourense, Spain. By combining two complementary visualization types we can easily identify those areas where both the number of wildfires and the burned areas are very high.

The `mapsf` package deprecates the well-known `cartography` package which was around for a while.
